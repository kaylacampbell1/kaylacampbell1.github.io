            <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
        <p class="about">I am 15. I currently am a sophomore at Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH).<br /></p>
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>In the future I see myself becoming a computer programmer and a model. Since I was smaller I was told that I should be a model but never got the chance because I have to focus on school at the moment. I also wanted to become a computer programmer since I was 11 years of age. I was very curious about where websites, apps, and games came from and so when I learned more I got more and more interested in the topic everyday.</p>
